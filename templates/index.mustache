    <p>
        Hi! This is my website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm {{age}} and a student,
        currently studying <a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/studium-weiterbildung/das-diplomstudium-humanmedizin/"><abbr title="Humanmedizin">human medicine</abbr></a>
        at the <a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/"><abbr title="Medizinische Universität Wien">Medical University of Vienna</abbr></a>
        in Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might know me <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7366707/moira">from Stack Overflow</a>;
        I occasionally check the Kotlin tag for any interesting questions and answers,
        or to see if I might be able to help someone out once in a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've done work on various projects in my free time,
        such as a <a href="https://github.com/stuhlmeier/kotlin-taskqueue">job processing</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/stuhlmeier/kotlin-events">event handling</a> system for Kotlin.
        I've also written <a href="https://github.com/stuhlmeier/gdpr">a summary of the GDPR</a> (CC-BY-SA)
        that may be helpful.

        <p>
            As I've spent most of my life on the move,
            I have lived and had quite a bit of experience in various places around the world.
            Perhaps as a consequence of this, I enjoy trying to learn new languages.

        I work primarily on Unix operating systems (Linux, macOS) as the quality of the tooling is simply unbeatable.
        Of course, I've used Windows fairly frequently regardless,
        because there's still enough software out there that unfortunately isn't entirely Linux-friendly,
        such as Unity, Office, Creative Cloud, etc.
